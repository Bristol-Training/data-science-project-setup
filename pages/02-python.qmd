title: "Python Environment Setup"

In the [previous section](./01-initial-setup.qmd), we showed you 
how to open a terminal, create a folder, and move "into" the 
folder. You will need to do this for every data science project.

Now that you are in this folder, you will want to install all
the tools you need for your code to run, and to do your research.
Virtual environments, which we create here, are a great way to keep 
all the tools you need organized alongside your code and 
separate from other projects.

#### What is a package manager?

A package manager is a tool that helps you install, update, and manage software libraries (called "packages") for a programming language. Packages essentially contain chunks of code that you might find useful,
that you don't want to write yourself!

For most python projects, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) will be 
a great choice of package manager. For notes on when you may want to use other package managers, see [here](./05-FAQs.qmd#)
::: 

## Install Package Manager

Package manager installation should only need
to be done **once** on your computer.

Instructions are included below. If you encounter any issues, see [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for more installation methods to try. Or contact the JGI team.

## Install UV

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Windows

Open your terminal and run:

```bat
winget install astral-uv.uv
```

### Mac

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash
```

### Linux

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash
```
:::

After installation, check that uv is available by 
typing `uv --version`, then pressing enter. You may need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

## Move into Project Directory

To set up your Python environment, you need to be in your project directory. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Create or navigate to your project directory.

If it is not clear how to do so, please refer to the [previous section](./01-initial-setup.qmd).

To check you are in the correct directory, enter the following
command:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Windows
```bat
cd
```

### Mac
```bash
pwd
```

### Linux

```bash
pwd
```
:::

### Create a Virtual Environment

Enter the following command to create a minimal virtual environment:

```bash
uv init --bare
```

This will create a `pyproject.toml` file, which will record information
on all of the packages you install in your virtual environment.

### Install Packages

For all projects we need jupyterlab, this is
where we edit code. This can be added to your project 
with this command:

```bash
uv add jupyterlab
```

For the [Introduction to Data Analysis in Python course](https://bristol-training.github.io/data-analysis-python-1/), you would need the `pandas` and `seaborn` package. You can add these with:

```bash
uv add pandas seaborn
```

Generally speaking, to add a package to your environment, you can use the following command:

```bash
uv add <package-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to install.

## Opening JupyterLab

Now you can open JupyterLab with:

```bash
uv run jupyter lab
```

This will take some time, and you will see text being
printed in the terminal. Once JupyterLab is running, a browser
window should pop open. This window should like similar to
the image below.

## Create a Notebook

To create a notebook, click the "Notebook" icon in the JupyterLab launcher. The window should now look like this:

![JupyterLab Notebook, with key features highlighted with arrows and blue boxes.](../assets/jupyterlab-notebook.png)

In each cell, python code can be entered. It can be run by clicking the "Run" button or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

## Summary

Well done, you have created an interactive JupyterLab environment for your Python project! You should now be able to follow along
with our [Python courses](https://bristol-training.github.io/courses.html#python). 

The steps in this page are crucial for setting up your Python environment effectively, and we recommend you follow these for your
own projects, as well as for our courses.
