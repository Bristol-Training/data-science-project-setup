Here we show you how to:

1. Open a Terminal
2. Create a folder
3. "Move into" that folder (change directory)

All the commands you need for these steps are included in this 
page. A [cheatsheet](./04-terminal-cheatsheet.qmd) is also 
available for quick reference.

If you already have a project folder created, simply skip the folder
creation step, and move into the existing folder.

## Open your Terminal
::: {.panel-tabset}

### Windows

Click the **Start** menu, search for **Commant Prompt**,
 and click to open. When you open the application you should 
see a blinking cursor preceded by 
something like this:

```bat
C:\Users\abc1234>
```

The text before the cursor indicates what folder you are "in". 

::: {.callout-note}
On Windows, the program used to run terminal commands is called **Command Prompt**.
:::


### Mac
Click the **Launchpad** (rocket icon), type **Terminal**, and press **Enter** to open it. You should see a prompt that looks like:

```bash
abc1234@Macbook %
```

The text prior to the cursor has your user name and the a name for the computer. You are "in" the home directory. To see where this directory is located, type the command `pwd`, then click **Enter**. 

### Linux

Open your terminal by pressing **Ctrl+Alt+T** or searching for **Terminal** in your applications menu. You should see a prompt similar to:

```bash
abc1234@Laptop:/
```

The text prior to the cursor has your user name and the a name for the computer. You are "in" the home directory. To see where this directory is located, type the command `pwd`, then click **Enter**.

## Creating a Folder

The commands to make a directory and navigate into
it are the same for Windows, Mac, and Linux. To create a new folder
and move into it, use the following commands in your 
Command Prompt/Terminal:

```bash
mkdir my_project
```

Press **Enter**.

# "Move Into" your Folder (Changing Directory)

To move into a folder (in this case named "my_project"), enter
the following command:

```bash
cd my_project
```

`mkdir my_project` creates a folder named `my_project`. `cd my_project` changes into that folder. Any other project name could 
be used. For ease, it is better that the project names do not
contain spaces, instead use `-` or `_`.

In windows, type `cd` and press enter to see the current directory. For Mac/Linux type `pwd` and press enter to see the current directory. 

To leave that folder, and go one step up, you can
enter the command `cd ..`.
