## What is a Terminal or Command Prompt?

A **terminal** (also called a **command prompt** on Windows) is a text-based interface that lets you interact with your computer by typing commands. Instead of clicking through menus, you type instructions directly.

- **Windows:** The terminal is called **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.
- **Mac:** The terminal app is called **Terminal**.
- **Linux:** Most distributions include a **Terminal** application.

## Basic Terminal Commands

Here are a few basic commands that work across most systems:

| Command         | Windows         | Mac/Linux         | Description                       |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| List files      | `dir`           | `ls`              | Shows files in the current folder |
| Change folder   | `cd foldername` | `cd foldername`   | Move into a folder                |
| Go up a folder  | `cd ..`         | `cd ..`           | Move up one level                 |
| Make a folder   | `mkdir name`    | `mkdir name`      | Create a new folder               |
| Remove a file   | `del file.txt`  | `rm file.txt`     | Delete a file                     |

## Why Use Terminal Commands?

Using basic terminal commands makes it easier to:

- **Navigate projects:** Quickly move between folders and files.
- **Run scripts:** Start Python or R scripts directly.
- **Manage environments:** Create and activate virtual environments for Python or R.
- **Automate tasks:** Use simple commands to install packages, update code, or clean up files.

Learning a few terminal commands helps you work more efficiently and gives you more control over your Python and R projects.
