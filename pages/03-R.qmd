## Installing R and RStudio

1. **Download and Install R**  
    - Visit [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and download R for your operating system.
    - Follow the installation instructions.

2. **Download and Install RStudio**  
    - Visit [RStudio Download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and download RStudio Desktop.
    - Install RStudio after installing R.

## Creating and Working Within a Folder

1. **Create a Project Folder**
    - In RStudio, go to `File` > `New Project` > `New Directory`.
    - Name your folder (e.g., `myproject`) and choose a location.
    - Click `Create Project`.

2. **Set Working Directory**
    - RStudio automatically sets the working directory to your project folder.
    - To check:  
      ```r
      getwd()
      ```
    - To set manually:  
      ```r
      setwd("/path/to/myproject")
      ```

## Bonus: Using `renv` for Package Management

1. **Initialize renv**
    ```r
    install.packages("renv")
    renv::init()
    ```

2. **Create a DESCRIPTION File**
    - In your project folder, create a file named `DESCRIPTION` with content like:
      ```
      Package: myproject
      Type: Project
      Title: Example Project
      Version: 0.1.0
      Imports:
            dplyr,
            ggplot2
      ```

3. **Install usethis and Use DESCRIPTION**
    ```r
    install.packages("usethis")
    usethis::use_description()
    ```

4. **Install Packages from DESCRIPTION**
    ```r
    renv::install("dplyr")
    renv::install("ggplot2")
    ```

5. **Snapshot the Environment**
    ```r
    renv::snapshot()
    ```

This workflow helps you organize your project, manage packages reproducibly, and share your setup with others.
