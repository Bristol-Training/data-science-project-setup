# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do I need to use a virtual environment?

Virtual environments help isolate your projectâ€™s dependencies from the rest of your system, ensuring that everyone working on the project uses the same package versions. This is essential for reproducible research, as it allows others to recreate your software environment and obtain the same results. Using a virtual environment also prevents conflicts between packages required for different projects.

## Why does every project need to be in a seperate folder?

## I've heard of other package managers in python (conda, pip, uv, pixi), which one should I use and when?


## Why do we use Jupyter Lab instead of VS Code?

We use **Jupyter Lab** as our primary IDE because it provides a simple and focused environment for learning. Unlike VS Code, Jupyter Lab does not require extensions or additional setup, and it does not include AI support or advanced features that may distract beginners. Our goal is to help students concentrate on core programming concepts without unnecessary complexity.

## Can I use other IDEs for my assignments?

While you are free to experiment with other IDEs on your own, we 
recommend using jupyter lab while you follow along with our courses.

## Do I need to install any extensions for Jupyter Lab?

No extensions are required. Jupyter Lab works out of the box for our course needs.



## Who can I contact if I have technical issues?

Please reach out to your instructor or teaching assistant for help with technical problems related to Jupyter Lab or the course setup.
