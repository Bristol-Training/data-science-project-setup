## UV (Recommended)

UV is a fast Python package manager and environment tool.

1. **Install UV**  
    If you don't have UV installed, run:
    ```sh
    curl -Ls https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/latest/download/uv-installer.sh | sh
    ```

2. **Create a new environment**  
    ```sh
    uv venv .venv
    ```

3. **Activate the environment**  
    ```sh
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. **Install packages**  
    For example, to install numpy and pandas:
    ```sh
    uv pip install numpy pandas
    ```

5. **Freeze dependencies**  
    ```sh
    uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

## Pixi

Pixi is a cross-platform package manager for Python and other languages.

1. **Install Pixi**  
    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
    ```

2. **Initialize a new project**  
    ```sh
    pixi init
    ```

3. **Add dependencies**  
    For example, to add numpy and pandas:
    ```sh
    pixi add numpy pandas
    ```

4. **Activate the environment**  
    ```sh
    pixi shell
    ```
