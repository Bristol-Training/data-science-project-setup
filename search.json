For example, to install the ggplot2 package, you would run:\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nYou can install multiple packages at once by passing a character vector to install.packages(). For example:\ninstall.packages(c(\"ggplot2\", \"dplyr\", \"tidyr\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus: Reproducible Environments in R (Not necessary, but encouraged!)\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people simply use the “install.packages()” function to install packages, but this does not ensure reproducibility. Instead, we recommend using the renv package to manage your R packages and their versions, and the DESCRIPTION file approach to record which packages you’ve installed. To install renv, run:\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\nWe also recommend installing the usethis package to help manage your project. `usethis includes great functionality for creating R-projects which follow standards.\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\n\nInitialise Environment\n\nInitialize renv: This creates a new project environment. Essentially a folder where project specific packages are installed, a document that tracks the packages used in the project, and a way to reproduce the environment later.\nrenv::init()\nCreate a DESCRIPTION File: This is a standard file in R that contains metadata about your project. The document created by renv contains a really long list of all packages used in the project, and the packages that those packages depend on! The DESCRIPTION file contains just a list of the packages you installed, making it easier for people to see what you’ve done. The template can easily be created using this command\nusethis::use_description(check_name = FALSE)\nInstall Packages from and add them to the description\nusethis::use_package(\"ggplot2\")\nSnapshot the Environment: After you’ve installed all your packages and added them to the DESCRIPTION file, you can create a snapshot of your environment. This will record the exact versions of all packages used in your project.\nrenv::snapshot()\n\nThis workflow helps you organize your project, manage packages reproducibly, and share your setup with others.",
