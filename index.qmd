This site provides guidance for setting up data science projects 
for the training we deliver, but also more generally when you 
begin to use `python` or `R` in your own work. 

We believe that the course we deliver should teach you programming
concepts, but also should set you up for using these 
tools in your everyday work.

**Main Steps**: Regardless of the language you are using, these are the key steps you need to follow
when starting training, or creating a new data science project:

For more specific instructions, see below:

- [Python](./pages/02-python.qmd)
- [R](./pages/03-R.qmd)
- See [here](./pages/04-terminal-cheatsheet.qmd) for a bit of a cheatsheet (some basics on using the terminal that you may find helpful)
- Why do we do it like this? See [here](./pages/05-FAQs.qmd) for FAQs 

There are many approaches to setting up and using R/python, 
but we have used our experience in teaching and using these 
tools to come up with a project setup that is simple and flexible enough for anyone to use. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to make suggestions

management and setting up reproducible data science projects
