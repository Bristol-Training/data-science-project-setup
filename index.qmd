This site provides guidance for setting up data science projects 
for the training we deliver, but also more generally when you 
begin to use `python` or `R` in your own work.

- Setup `python` [here](./pages/01-python.qmd)
- Setup `R` [here](./pages/02-R.qmd)
- See [here](./pages/03-terminal-cheatsheet.qmd) for a bit of a cheatsheet (some basics on using the terminal that you may find helpful)
- See [here](./pages/04-FAQs.qmd) for FAQs 

There are other approaches to setting up and using R/python, 
but we have used our experience in teaching and using these 
tools to come up with a project setup that has a balance 
of simplicity but also use for reproducible research. If you
have any suggestions, please feel free to make suggestions
