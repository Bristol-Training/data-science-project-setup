This site provides guidance for setting up data science projects 
for the training we deliver, but also more generally when you 
begin to use `python` or `R` in your own work. 

We believe that the course we deliver should teach you programming
concepts, but also should set you up for using these 
tools in your everyday work.

**Main Steps**: Regardless of the language you are using, these are the key steps you need to follow
when starting training, or creating a new data science project:

For more specific instructions, see below:

- [Python](./pages/02-python.qmd)
- [R](./pages/03-R.qmd)
- See [here](./pages/04-terminal-cheatsheet.qmd) for a bit of a cheatsheet (some basics on using the terminal that you may find helpful)
- Why do we do it like this? See [here](./pages/05-FAQs.qmd) for FAQs 

There are many approaches to setting up and using R/python, 
but we have used our experience in teaching and using these 
tools to come up with a project setup that has a balance 
of simplicity but also use for reproducible research. If you
have any suggestions, please feel free to make suggestions

management and setting up reproducible data science projects
